## Directory List

|            Field             |   Type    | Size (bytes) | Offset (bytes) | Description                                                                        |
|:----------------------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:--------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              ⋮               |     ⋮     |      ⋮       |       ⋮        | ⋮                                                                                  |
|        Directory Path        |   `str`   |      n       |    ... + 0     | Null-terminated directory path string relative to the assets folder (without ./)   |
|              ⋮               |     ⋮     |      ⋮       |       ⋮        | ⋮                                                                                  |
| End of Directory List Marker | `[u8; 4]` |      4       |      ...       | `[0xFF, 0x10, 0xFF, 0x00]` Marks the end of the Directory List.[^null-termination] |

[^null-termination]: This has to end with `0x00` because when parsing the TOC and the Directory List, the implementation
    will be reading the next null-terminated string for the path. The implementation should always check if the file
    path is equal to the end marker.

## File Flags

|  Bit   | Usage                                                               |
|:------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x80` | Unused.                                                             |
| `0x40` | Unused.                                                             |
| `0x20` | Unused.                                                             |
| `0x10` | Unused.                                                             |
| `0x08` | Unused.                                                             |
| `0x04` | `0b1` if the file is compressed with lz4.                           |
| `0x02` | `0b1` if the file is unique to the pack.[^unique]                   |
| `0x01` | `0b1` if the file is stored in its raw form[^raw], `0b0` otherwise. |

[^unique]: Files placed in the `__unique__` folder of the asset pack will be marked as "unique". The purpose of this is
    for storing information per asset pack in asset pack directories, where asset packs can overwrite assets from the 
    default asset pack. 

[^raw]: Normally, assets are stored as "intermediate formats", such as `.png` for images, `.ogg` for audio, etc. At 
    runtime, the game will have to load these assets and transform them into a format that the game engine understands, 
    such as a vector of RGBA values for images. The game engine can save a lot of time loading assets if they are 
    already transformed into the raw format beforehand.

    The asset pack plugin provides a trait which users can implement to transform files from an intermediate format into
    a raw format. Note that because of this, this feature is not restricted to only storing "raw" formats. The user can
    transform any asset file into any other form if they wish. An example of such a usage is obfuscating text-based 
    assets.
